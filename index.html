		<h1>Luke Davidson</h1>
		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan with four siblings and two parents who serve the LORD in what they do. While I was persuing a career in the United States Air Force as a fighter pilot, God, by the prayers of family and pastors, called me to persue full-time ministry. A friend of mine persuaded me to enter into a preaching competition in eighth grade. God used him to expose to me a gift I was given of the Lord. The day I preached I won first place in the entire state. That event was the beginning of a long career of willing competitions. In total, God blessed me to recieve nine gold medals one silver medal, and one bronze medal in preaching. Those medals are worthless materialistically, but they do indicate growth in my life as an aspiring preacher. I also preached at my church, school, and other events as a service to the King. Since my dedication to the call of the ministry, I have persued the call to preach. I am currently attending Bob Jones University persuing a degree in Cross-cultural Service with elective in aviation and music in mind.</p>
<p>I started playing the clarinet when I was in fifth grade. However, it was not until my tenth grade year of high school that I actually appreciated music. I started to have an affinity for cultural instruments, so I decided to pick up the ocarina. Not much longer after that, I decided to lern how to play the penny whistle and shortly after the harmonica. The only instrument that I gave up on was the scottish chanter. While I was involved in music, I started to pick up the piano, having a father who plays it well. Further along in my senior year of high school, I decided to enter in a singing competition to sing, having good results at the end. The boundries of my musical instrument invetory ends at the Appalachian mountain dulcimer. God has blessed me with an ability and an ear to pick up musical instruments on my own; I taught myself to play every instrument I own except for my clarinet. The height of my journey into music is my hymn writing. I have composed almost twenty hymns before high school graduation and more are currently underway. While the preaching ministry is paramount in my mind, music is a side ministry, of which God will be glorified.<p/>
