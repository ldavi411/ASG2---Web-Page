		<h1>Luke Davidson</h1>
		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan with four siblings and two parents who serve the LORD in what they do. While I was persuing a career in the United States Air Force as a fighter pilot, God, by the prayers of family and pastors, called me to persue full-time ministry. Since then, I have persued the call to preach with writing hymns as a side ministry. I am currently attending Bob Jones University persuing a degree in Cross-cultural Service with elective in aviation and music in mind.</p>

		<p>Isaiah 6:8: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me."</p>
